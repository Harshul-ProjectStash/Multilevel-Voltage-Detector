# Multilevel-Voltage-Detector
This repository houses the report for the 'Multilevel Voltage Detector' project. It details the process of leading the creation of the device, which uses the ZMPT101B sensor to detect AC voltage levels ranging from 0-300V. The report includes stages of circuit design, PCB layout, system assembly, and rigorous testing, resulting in a reliable voltage monitoring solution. Additionally, it describes the integration of a self-powering feature and safety measures like electrical isolation to ensure both operational stability and safety.
